# Coding for ML implementation in a Diabetic Foot Ulcer Database

This project contains the structure for statistical research and AI classification applied to the {diabetes dataset}. It can be used a general structure for a plethora of (future) applications such as the prediction of diabetic foot ulcera healing, or probability of amputation.

### Future project ideas
- Create web application.
- Code conversion to python if web application is run remotely.
- Generalize code for ease of use.
- Try hybrid models, neural networks when dataset it extended.
